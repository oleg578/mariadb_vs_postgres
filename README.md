# mariadb_vs_postgres

This project demonstrates a comparative setup and usage of MariaDB and PostgreSQL using Docker containers. It includes:

- Docker Compose files for both MariaDB and PostgreSQL
- SQL scripts to initialize a `product` table compatible with both databases
- Python scripts to populate the table with fake data and measure query performance
- Example connection strings (DSN) for both databases

## Features

- Easily start MariaDB and PostgreSQL containers with pre-configured databases
- Populate the `product` table with 10,000,000 fake products
- Measure and compare query execution times for both databases
- Ready-to-use Python classes and scripts for data generation and benchmarking

## Usage

1. Start the containers using Docker Compose
2. Run the provided Python scripts to populate and test the databases
3. Compare results and performance
